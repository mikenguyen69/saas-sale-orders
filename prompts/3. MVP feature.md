🎯 MVP Feature Breakdown (Phase 1)

1. Order Management (Core)

- Multi-channel order capture
  -- Shopify app integration (highest demand in SMB ecommerce).
  -- WooCommerce plugin.
  -- Manual order entry screen.
  -- CSV/Excel order import (for sellers migrating from spreadsheets).
- Order status workflow (New → Processing → Shipped → Completed → Cancelled).
- Basic search & filter (by customer, SKU, date, status).

✅ Why now? Capturing orders across channels is the #1 SMB pain. Without this, you’re not solving their problem.

2. Inventory Management (Lightweight)

- Centralized SKU catalog (with stock levels).
- Real-time sync with connected channels (Shopify, Woo).
- Stock reservations when order is created (avoid overselling).
- Manual stock adjustments (damaged, restock, etc.).

✅ Why now? Overselling kills SMB credibility → refunds & bad reviews. A simple, reliable sync is a killer feature.

3. Fulfillment & Shipping

- Basic pick/pack workflow
- Print pick list (per order / batch).
- Mark order as packed.
- Carrier integration (via Shippo or ShipEngine API)
- Generate shipping label.
- Update order with tracking number.
- Automatic customer email notification with tracking info.

✅ Why now? SMBs want to ship fast without retyping addresses into courier websites.

4. Returns / Refund Handling (Simple)

- Mark an order as “Returned.”
- Restock option (toggle to add item back to inventory).
- Add refund note (manual tracking, integration with payment gateway can come later).

✅ Why now? Even a light return flow prevents churn compared to competitors who require an upgrade tier.

5. User & Tenant Management

- Multi-tenant SaaS setup (each business has isolated data).
- Roles: Admin (full), Staff (restricted).
- Subscription & billing integration (Stripe Checkout).
- Self-serve trial & upgrade/downgrade.

✅ Why now? Critical for SaaS viability. Without billing + roles, you can’t monetize or run safely.

6. Customer Communication

- Order confirmation + shipping notification emails (templated, customizable with company logo).
- Dashboard widget showing order fulfillment SLA (e.g., % shipped within 24 hrs).

✅ Why now? Customers value reassurance. Sellers value reducing support calls.

7. Analytics / Dashboard (Basic)

- Orders today / this month.
- Revenue from orders.
- Top-selling SKUs.
- Low-stock alerts (threshold-based).

✅ Why now? Simple reporting = perceived value; sellers want to “see business at a glance.”

8. API & Integrations

- Public REST API (for orders, inventory, fulfillment).
- Webhooks (order.created, order.shipped).

✅ Why now? Gives you early traction with tech-savvy SMBs and developers who build custom workflows.
