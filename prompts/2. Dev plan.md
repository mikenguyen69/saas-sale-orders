# Development Plan for Sales Order Management SaaS

To build the sales order management SaaS while ensuring quality code, we'll break down the functionality into logical phases. This modular approach promotes maintainability, testability, and scalability. Each phase focuses on a specific aspect, allowing for incremental development, testing, and iteration. We'll follow best practices like Test-Driven Development (TDD) where applicable, code linting (ESLint/Prettier), type safety (TypeScript), and modular architecture (e.g., separate concerns for models, services, controllers).

The plan assumes a solo or small team developer using the recommended tech stack (Next.js, Supabase, React + MUI, etc.). Total estimated timeline: 4-6 weeks for an MVP, depending on experience. Use Git for version control, with feature branches for each module.

## Phase 1: Project Setup and Infrastructure (1-2 days)

**Goal**: Establish a solid foundation to avoid rework later. Focus on configuration for quality (e.g., type safety, linting).

- **Tasks**:
  - Initialize Next.js project with TypeScript: `npx create-next-app@latest --typescript`.
  - Set up Supabase: Create a project, enable Auth, and configure environment variables (e.g., `.env.local` with `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`).
  - Integrate Prisma: Install `@prisma/client` and `prisma`, generate schema from the database schema, and run initial migrations.
  - Configure authentication: Use Supabase Auth with Next.js middleware for RBAC (e.g., protect API routes based on user roles).
  - Add linting and formatting: Install ESLint, Prettier, and Husky. Configure rules for consistent code style.
  - Set up Docker for local dev consistency (optional but recommended for Supabase emulation).
  - Basic folder structure: `/app` for pages, `/api` for routes, `/components` for UI, `/lib` for utilities (e.g., Prisma client), `/services` for business logic.

- **Quality Assurance**:
  - Run initial lint and format checks.
  - Write a smoke test (Jest) for the homepage.
  - Commit to Git and set up Vercel for preview deploys.

## Phase 2: Database and Core Models (2-3 days)

**Goal**: Implement the data layer with integrity. This ensures schemas are correct before building APIs/UI.

- **Tasks**:
  - Define Prisma schema for `products`, `sale_orders`, `order_items`, `attachments`, `users`, and `order_status_history`.
  - Add enums for `status` (`draft`, `submitted`, `approved`, `fulfilled`, `rejected`) and `role` (`salesperson`, `manager`, `warehouse`).
  - Implement triggers: Use Supabase SQL functions/triggers for stock deduction on fulfillment and logging to `order_status_history`.
  - Enable RLS policies: e.g., salespeople can only read/write their own drafts.
  - Seed initial data: Add sample products and users via Prisma scripts.
  - (Optional) Add `suppliers` table if needed.

- **Quality Assurance**:
  - Use Prisma Studio to verify schema and data.
  - Write unit tests (Jest) for triggers (e.g., simulate fulfillment and check stock update).
  - Ensure soft-deletes are handled (add `deleted_at` field and filter queries).

## Phase 3: API Development (4-6 days)

**Goal**: Build secure, modular APIs following the defined endpoints. Break into sub-modules by functionality.

- **Sub-Modules**:
  - **User Management (1 day)**: Implement `/api/v1/users` for CRUD (admin only). Include role assignment.
  - **Product Management (1 day)**: `/api/v1/products` for listing/searching with stock info.
  - **Order CRUD (2 days)**: `/api/v1/orders` (POST for create draft, PUT for update, GET for view/list). Add pagination and filtering.
  - **Workflow Actions (2 days)**: Action endpoints like `/submit`, `/approve`, `/reject`, `/warehouse`. Integrate validation rules (e.g., stock checks with Zod, recalculate `line_total`).
    - Use services for business logic (e.g., `orderService.submitOrder()` handles validation and status update).
    - Trigger notifications (SendGrid) on status changes.

- **Quality Assurance**:
  - TDD: Write tests for each endpoint (e.g., happy path, edge cases like out-of-stock).
  - Use Zod for input validation to prevent invalid data.
  - Implement idempotency (e.g., unique keys for submits to avoid duplicates).
  - Integration tests: Mock Supabase and test full flows (e.g., create → submit → approve).
  - Security: Enforce JWT auth and RBAC in middleware.

## Phase 4: Frontend Development (5-7 days)

**Goal**: Build interactive UI with role-based views. Modularize components for reusability.

- **Sub-Modules**:
  - **Auth and Layout (1 day)**: Login page with Supabase Auth. Shared layout with role-based navigation.
  - **Product Listing (1 day)**: Page to view/search products (use React Query for fetching).
  - **Order Form (2-3 days)**: Core page with MUI DataGrid for line items. Implement editing, highlighting out-of-stock, and buttons (Save Draft, Submit) conditionally by role.
    - Use React Hook Form + Yup for validation.
    - Handle file uploads (Supabase Storage) for attachments.
  - **Order List and Details (1-2 days)**: Dashboard for listing orders (filtered by role). Details view with workflow buttons (Approve, Reject, Fulfill).
    - Add partial fulfillment support via `line_status` updates.

- **Quality Assurance**:
  - Component tests (React Testing Library): Test rendering, interactions (e.g., quantity input validation).
  - Ensure a11y: Add ARIA labels, test keyboard navigation.
  - Mobile testing: Use browser dev tools for responsiveness.
  - Optimistic updates with React Query for smooth UX (e.g., instant status changes).

## Phase 5: Workflow, Validation, and Integrations (3-4 days)

**Goal**: Tie everything together with business logic. Ensure the state machine and rules work end-to-end.

- **Tasks**:
  - Implement full workflow: Dynamic stock re-validation on approve/fulfill.
  - Add partial fulfillment: Update `line_status` in DataGrid.
  - Integrate notifications: Use Supabase Edge Functions for emails on submits/approvals.
  - Error handling: Centralized API errors, MUI Snackbar for UI feedback.
  - Analytics: Set up Mixpanel for tracking key events (e.g., order created).

- **Quality Assurance**:
  - E2E tests (Cypress): Simulate full flows (e.g., salesperson creates draft → manager approves → warehouse fulfills).
  - Handle race conditions: Use Prisma transactions for stock updates.
  - Manual testing: Role-switch simulations (e.g., log in as different users).

## Phase 6: Testing, Monitoring, and Deployment (2-3 days)

**Goal**: Polish and launch the MVP with observability.

- **Tasks**:
  - Full test suite: Aim for 80%+ coverage (unit, integration, E2E).
  - Set up monitoring: Integrate Sentry for error tracking.
  - Deploy to Vercel: Configure production env, custom domain.
  - CI/CD: GitHub Actions for auto-tests/deploys on push.

- **Quality Assurance**:
  - Security scan: Check for OWASP issues (e.g., manual review of notes for XSS).
  - Performance: Optimize queries with indexes.
  - Documentation: Update the plan with any changes; add inline code comments.

## General Best Practices for Quality Code

- **Modularity**: Keep functions small (<50 lines), separate concerns (e.g., no DB calls in UI components).
- **TDD/BDD**: Write tests before code where possible.
- **Code Reviews**: Even solo, use pull requests and self-review.
- **Error Handling**: Use try-catch blocks, return standardized JSON errors.
- **Documentation**: Comment critical logic, maintain README for setup.
- **Performance**: Use indexes for frequent queries, cache with React Query.
- **Security**: Sanitize inputs (notes), use prepared statements, enforce RLS.
